## 🎯 Overview

This project monitors live traffic camera feeds and uses computer vision (YOLOv8) to detect vehicles in real-time. The system captures screenshots from traffic cameras, runs object detection to identify vehicles, and analyzes the data for potential accident indicators such as overlapping vehicles or unusual traffic patterns.

## ✨ Features

- **Automated Screenshot Capture**: Uses Selenium to access live traffic camera feeds
- **Real-time Object Detection**: YOLOv8 identifies vehicles (cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles) and other objects
- **Visual Annotations**: Saves images with bounding boxes around detected objects
- **Traffic Analysis**: Analyzes vehicle positions, counts, and potential collisions
- **Batch Processing**: Processes multiple frames and generates aggregate statistics
- **Overlap Detection**: Identifies overlapping vehicles as potential collision indicators

python -c "from ultralytics import YOLO; import cv2; from selenium import webdriver; print('✓ All packages installed successfully!')"
```

## 🔍 How It Works

### Script 1: `yolo_screenshot_detector.py`

This is the main capture and detection script. Here's what it does:

#### **Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Initialization**
   - Loads the YOLOv8 nano model (`yolov8n.pt`)
   - Clears previous captures from `captures/` and `captures_annotated/` folders
   - Creates fresh directories

2. **Browser Setup**
   - Opens Firefox browser using Selenium
   - Maximizes the window for full view
   - Navigates to TDOT traffic camera URL
   - Waits 5 seconds for page to fully load

3. **Capture Loop** (runs 5 times by default, every 2 seconds)
   - Takes a screenshot using Selenium's built-in capture (browser window only)
   - Converts PNG bytes to OpenCV image format
   - Saves raw screenshot to `captures/` folder

4. **YOLO Detection**
   - Runs YOLOv8 object detection on the captured image
   - Identifies objects (cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, people, etc.)
   - Records bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores

5. **Annotation & Saving**
   - Draws bounding boxes with labels on the image
   - Saves annotated image to `captures_annotated/` folder
   - Prints detection details to console

6. **Cleanup**
   - Closes the browser
   - Displays summary of saved files

#### **Key Code Sections:**

```python
# Browser screenshot (not full screen)
png_bytes = browser.get_screenshot_as_png()
image = cv2.imdecode(np.frombuffer(png_bytes, np.uint8), cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)

# YOLO inference
results = model(image)
result = results[0]

# Draw annotations
annotated_frame = result.plot()
```

### Script 2: `detection_analysis_example.py`

This script performs detailed analysis on captured images.

#### **Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Image Discovery**
   - Scans `captures_annotated/` folder for all PNG files
   - Sorts images by filename (timestamp order)

2. **Per-Image Analysis**
   - Loads each annotated image
   - Re-runs YOLO detection to extract data
   - Identifies vehicle types and positions
   - Calculates bounding box centers and areas

3. **Overlap Detection**
   - Compares all vehicle bounding boxes
   - Calculates IoU (Intersection over Union)
   - Flags overlaps > 20% as potential collisions
   - Counts high-confidence detections

4. **Aggregate Statistics**
   - Total vehicles across all frames
   - Average vehicles per frame
   - Frame with most vehicles
   - Frames with overlaps (⚠️ potential accidents)

5. **Future Recommendations**
   - Provides notes on implementing advanced accident detection
   - Suggests frame-to-frame tracking
   - Recommends custom model training

#### **Key Analysis Features:**

```python
# IoU calculation for overlap detection
def boxes_overlap(box1, box2, threshold=0.2):
    # Calculates intersection over union
    # Returns True if IoU > threshold
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Change Camera URL

Edit line 29 in `yolo_screenshot_detector.py`:

```python
url = "https://smartway.tn.gov/allcams/camera/3245"  # Change camera ID here
```

**Finding other cameras:**
- Visit: https://smartway.tn.gov/traffic
- Browse available cameras
- Copy the camera URL

### Change Number of Captures

Edit line 33 in `yolo_screenshot_detector.py`:

```python
for i in range(5):  # Change 5 to desired number of screenshots
```

### Change Capture Interval

Edit line 34 in `yolo_screenshot_detector.py`:

```python
time.sleep(2)  # Change 2 to desired seconds between captures
```

### Use Different YOLO Model

Edit line 13 in `yolo_screenshot_detector.py`:

```python
model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")  # Options: yolov8n, yolov8s, yolov8m, yolov8l, yolov8x
```

**Model Comparison:**

| Model    | Size  | Speed      | Accuracy | Use Case              |
|----------|-------|------------|----------|-----------------------|
| yolov8n  | ~6MB  | Fastest    | Good     | Real-time, testing    |
| yolov8s  | ~22MB | Fast       | Better   | Balanced              |
| yolov8m  | ~50MB | Moderate   | High     | Accuracy priority     |
| yolov8l  | ~87MB | Slow       | Higher   | High-end systems      |
| yolov8x  | ~131MB| Slowest    | Highest  | Maximum accuracy      |

### Adjust Overlap Detection Threshold

Edit line 88 in `detection_analysis_example.py`:

```python
def boxes_overlap(box1, box2, threshold=0.2):  # 0.2 = 20% IoU threshold
```

Lower threshold = more sensitive to overlaps  
Higher threshold = only detects significant overlaps

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Error: "geckodriver not found"

**Problem**: Selenium can't find the browser driver.

**Solution**:
1. Download geckodriver: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
2. Extract the executable
3. Add to PATH:
   - Windows: Add folder to System Environment Variables
   - Or place `geckodriver.exe` in Python's Scripts folder

### Error: "No module named 'ultralytics'"

**Problem**: Dependencies not installed.

**Solution**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Error: "CUDA not available" or Slow Performance

**Problem**: Running on CPU instead of GPU.

**Solution** (Optional - for GPU acceleration):
```bash
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

**Note**: CPU is sufficient for this project. GPU provides faster processing.

### Browser Opens but Shows Blank Screenshots

**Problem**: Page not fully loaded before screenshot.

**Solution**: Increase wait time (line 31 in `yolo_screenshot_detector.py`):
```python
time.sleep(10)  # Increase from 5 to 10 seconds
```

### Error: "No images found in captures_annotated/ folder"

**Problem**: Haven't run the capture script yet.

**Solution**: Run capture script first:
```bash
python yolo_screenshot_detector.py
```

### Firefox Not Opening

**Problem**: Browser path not found or using wrong browser.

**Solution 1** - Use Chrome instead:
```python
browser = webdriver.Chrome()  # Replace line 27
```

**Solution 2** - Specify Firefox path:
```python
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.service import Service
service = Service('C:\\Path\\To\\Firefox\\firefox.exe')
browser = webdriver.Firefox(service=service)
```

### Script Runs But No Detections

**Problem**: Camera view may be empty or quality issue.

**Check**:
- Verify camera URL is working in regular browser
- Check if it's nighttime (lower detection accuracy)
- Try different camera angle/location
- Lower confidence threshold if needed

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
